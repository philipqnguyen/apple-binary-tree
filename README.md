# Apple Binary Tree Organization

A binary tree of a fake organization heierarchy in Apple. The point of this is to show three different binary tree traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal.

Look at the apple_tree_spec.rb to see the specs for each of the methods. run `rake` to see the specs pass.
